This project is under GPL licences. 
This uses ESP8266 microcontroller for the project.
This project can operate a solenoid valve manually using the web pages to on/off the valve. Also it can control your garden or agriculture using the software timer. These timers are written in c langguage using circular double link list. 
The objective of the project is use Artificial Intelligence in Drip irrigation control system . A soil moisture sensor to be 
developed using image Pattern recognition for the automated recognition of patterns and regularities  soil and judge the moisture 
instead of normal sensor. Drip irrigation timer to be controlled using esp now protocol. 

Issues to be solved.
-------------------
1) timer settings from front end.
2) creating AP mode 
3) solve the problem related to timer restart after power failure.
